üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Email Analysis Report
üìå Subject: "Refund Pending ‚Äì IRCTC"
üñºÔ∏è Overview
This email is a simulated phishing attempt, appearing to come from IRCTC Helpdesk and offering a refund of ‚Çπ4,240 due to an alleged overcharge on an IRCTC transaction. The user is urged to scan a QR code and verify their mobile number to receive the refund.

üö© Identified Red Flags
Suspicious Sender Email Address:

irtcc-helpdesk@securesupportcloud[.]com

Red Flag: The domain name is not related to IRCTC (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation). Legitimate emails from IRCTC would use @irctc.co.in.

Urgency/Time Limit:

Phrases like "This link will expire in 2 business days" are used to pressure the user into acting quickly.

Red Flag: Creating a sense of urgency is a common tactic in phishing to prevent careful consideration.

Unexpected Refund Claim:

The user is told of a refund without having initiated any complaint.

Red Flag: This is a classic phishing strategy ‚Äî "free money" to lure users.

Use of QR Code:

QR codes are used to obscure the final destination URL.

Red Flag: Scanning the QR code might lead to credential harvesting or a malicious site.

Generic Language:

No personal identification, transaction ID, or booking reference is included.

Red Flag: Legitimate refund emails usually contain specific details related to the user‚Äôs account or transaction.

Email Layout and Branding:

IRCTC logo used, but poor formatting and layout suggest it's fake.

Red Flag: Visual identity may be spoofed but inconsistencies give it away.
